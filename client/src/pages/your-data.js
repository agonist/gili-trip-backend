      <P>
        If you don’t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your
        browser to refuse cookies from{" "}

      <H2>What is a cookie?</H2>
      <P>
        A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device
        when you visit, typically containing information about the website
        itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web
        browser when you return, additional data that serves the purpose of the
        cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.
      </P>
      <P>
        Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track
        site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user settings (eg. timezone,
        notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg.
        advertising, language).
      </P>
      <P>
        Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as
        “first-party cookies”, and typically only track your activity on that
        particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie. third
        parties) are called “third-party cookies”, and can be used to track you
        on other websites that use the same third-party service.
      </P>
      <H2>How you can control or opt out of cookies</H2>
      <P>
        If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your
        browser to refuse cookies from our website. Most browsers are configured
        to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to
        either refuse cookies altogether, or to notify you when a website is
        trying to set or update a cookie.
      </P>
      <P>
        If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update
        your settings on each individual device.
      </P>
      <P>
        Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your
        experience of a website, blocking all cookies may mean you are unable to
        access certain features and content across the sites you visit.
